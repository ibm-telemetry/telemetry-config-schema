# IBM Telemetry config file schema

This repository contains the configuration file schema for
[IBM Telemetry](https://github.com/ibm-telemetry).

IBM Telemetry's config file schema is applied through metadata files written in YAML. If you're new
to YAML and want to learn more, see
"[Learn YAML in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml)." Below is the latest stable
version of the schema.

## Stable version

The current supported stable version of the config schema is _v1_. You can add the YAML language
server to your YAML files by adding the following line to the top of your files:

```yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://unpkg.com/@ibm/telemetry-config-schema@v0/dist/config.schema.json
```

**_Note:_** If you're using VS Code as your editor you may
[install](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace) a YAML extension, such as
[YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) for additional
language support such as validation and autoâ€“complete.

### Sample

```yaml path="telemetry.yml"
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://unpkg.com/@ibm/telemetry-config-schema@v1/dist/config.schema.json
version: 1
projectId: 'project id'
endpoint: 'http://example.com/v1/metrics'
collect:
  npm:
    dependencies:
  jsx:
    elements:
      allowedAttributeNames:
        - 'size'
        - 'title'
      allowedAttributeStringValues:
        - 'small'
        - 'medium'
        - 'large'
        - 'title1'
        - 'title2'
```

## Collect schema

The keys under `collect` represent the various types of data that Telemetry is capable of collecting
(i.e. `scopes`).

> **Note**: At least one scope is required.

```yaml
---
collect:
  npm:
    dependencies:
  jsx:
    elements:
      allowedAttributeNames:
        - 'size'
        - 'title'
      allowedAttributeStringValues:
        - 'small'
        - 'medium'
        - 'large'
        - 'title1'
        - 'title2'
```

## Collect keys (scopes)

| Key   | Description                                                                                                     | Required | Type   |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| `npm` | Configuration for collecting telemetry data from an npm environment. See [NPM scope](#npm-scope) for more info. | Optional | Object |
| `jsx` | Configuration for collecting telemetry data from JSX files. See [JSX scope](#jsx-scope) for more info.          | Optional | Object |

### NPM scope

This scope applies to NPM environments.

#### `dependencies` metric

Captures data relating to the instrumented package's installer(s) and dependencies installed
alongside it. Specifically:

- Project names and versions that installed the instrumented package at the instrumented version.
- Package names and versions that are installed along with the instrumented package at the
  instrumented version.

This data can help answer questions such as:

- What projects are consuming my package?
- What is the distribution of different versions of my package that consumers are using?
- What percentage of consumers are using the latest version of my package?
- What version of React/Angular/Vue... are consumers most using along with my package?

```yaml
---
npm:
  dependencies:
  # or
  # dependencies: null
```

### JSX Scope

This scope is only applicable to React packages. This scope may be useful to configure if the
package you're instrumenting exports React components.

#### `elements` metric

Captures (JSX) element-specific usage data for the instrumented package. Specifically:

- All elements exported through the instrumented package that are being used in a given project that
  installed the package
- Element configurations (attributes and values), as determined by the `allowedAttributeNames` and
  `allowedAttributeStringValues` config options (see below for additional information)
- Import paths used to access the instrumented package's exported elements

This data can help you answer questions such as:

- What is the most widely used element exported through my package?
- What is the least widely used element exported through my package?
- What are the most commonly used attributes for a given element exported through my package?
- How many times does "project x" use my exported Button element?

By default, the `jsx.elements` metrics will collect element names, anonymized element attribute
names, and anonymized element attribute values. Boolean and numeric attribute values are always
collected in plain text. The following config options allow certain string values to be collected in
plain text (instead of as anonymized strings).

- `allowedAttributeNames`: This is an _optional_ array of strings.

  Enables plain-text collection of specific JSX attribute names (prop names). These are collected
  for all discovered JSX elements imported from the instrumented package.

  At least one string value is required if this key is defined.

- `allowedAttributeStringValues`: This is an _optional_ array of strings.

  Enables plain-text collection of specific JSX attribute values (prop values). These are collected
  for discovered JSX attributes included in the `allowedAttributeNames` list.

  At least one value is required if this key is defined.

### Sample:

```yaml path="sample-telemetry.yml"
---
jsx:
  elements:
    allowedAttributeNames:
      - 'size'
      - 'title'
    allowedAttributeStringValues:
      - 'small'
      - 'medium'
      - 'large'
      - 'title1'
      - 'title2'
```
